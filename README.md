# sovran-state

A lightweight, Redux-inspired state management library for Rust that encourages composable, granular state management. Unlike traditional Redux which uses a single state tree, sovran-state allows you to maintain multiple independent state containers, making it ideal for modular applications.

## Features

- ðŸš€ Multiple state containers in a single store
- ðŸ”’ Thread-safe state management
- ðŸŽ¯ Type-safe actions and state updates
- ðŸ“¦ Zero dependencies
- ðŸ”„ Predictable state updates through actions
- ðŸ“¢ Subscribe to specific state changes
- âš¡ Efficient action dispatching with FIFO ordering

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
sovran-state = "0.1.0"
```

## Quick Start

```rust
use sovran_state::{Store, State, Action};

// Define your state
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
struct CounterState {
    value: i32,
}

impl State for CounterState {}

// Define an action
struct IncrementAction;

impl Action<CounterState> for IncrementAction {
    fn reduce(&self, state: CounterState) -> CounterState {
        CounterState { value: state.value + 1 }
    }
}

// Use the store
fn main() {
    // Create a new store
    let store = Store::new();
    
    // Provide initial state
    store.provide(CounterState { value: 0 }).unwrap();
    
    // Subscribe to state changes
    store.subscribe(|state: &CounterState| {
        println!("Counter value: {}", state.value);
    }).unwrap();
    
    // Dispatch an action
    store.dispatch(IncrementAction).unwrap();
}
```

## Why sovran-state?

While Redux is great for JavaScript applications, its pattern of using a single state tree doesn't always translate well to Rust applications. sovran-state takes the best parts of Redux (predictable state updates, action-based mutations) and adapts them to be more idiomatic in Rust:

- **Multiple State Types**: Instead of maintaining a giant state object, you can have multiple smaller, focused state containers.
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Rust's type system to ensure type-safe state updates and action handling.
- **Thread Safety**: Built with concurrency in mind, making it suitable for multi-threaded applications.
- **Modular Design**: Each state type is independent, making it easier to maintain and test different parts of your application.

## Usage Examples

### Managing Multiple States

```rust
use sovran_state::{Store, State, Action};

// First state type
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
struct UserState {
    name: String,
    logged_in: bool,
}

impl State for UserState {}

// Second state type
#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
struct ThemeState {
    dark_mode: bool,
}

impl State for ThemeState {}

// Actions
struct LoginAction(String);
struct ToggleThemeAction;

impl Action<UserState> for LoginAction {
    fn reduce(&self, state: UserState) -> UserState {
        UserState {
            name: self.0.clone(),
            logged_in: true,
        }
    }
}

impl Action<ThemeState> for ToggleThemeAction {
    fn reduce(&self, state: ThemeState) -> ThemeState {
        ThemeState { dark_mode: !state.dark_mode }
    }
}

// Usage
let store = Store::new();

// Provide initial states
store.provide(UserState { name: String::new(), logged_in: false }).unwrap();
store.provide(ThemeState { dark_mode: false }).unwrap();

// Subscribe to specific state changes
store.subscribe(|user: &UserState| {
    println!("User state changed: {:?}", user);
}).unwrap();

store.subscribe(|theme: &ThemeState| {
    println!("Theme changed: {:?}", theme);
}).unwrap();

// Dispatch actions
store.dispatch(LoginAction("Alice".to_string())).unwrap();
store.dispatch(ToggleThemeAction).unwrap();
```

### Thread-Safe State Management

```rust
use std::thread;
use sovran_state::{Store, State, Action};

#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
struct CounterState {
    value: i32,
}

impl State for CounterState {}

struct IncrementAction;

impl Action<CounterState> for IncrementAction {
    fn reduce(&self, state: CounterState) -> CounterState {
        CounterState { value: state.value + 1 }
    }
}

let store = Store::new();
store.provide(CounterState { value: 0 }).unwrap();

let store_clone = store.clone();
let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
    store_clone.dispatch(IncrementAction).unwrap();
});

handle.join().unwrap();
```

## Error Handling

The library uses a `StoreError` enum to handle various error cases:

```rust
pub enum StoreError {
    StateNotFound,
    WrongStateType,
    StateAlreadyExists,
    LockError,
}
```
